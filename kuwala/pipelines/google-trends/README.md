# Google Trends

### EXPERIMENTAL: Pipeline is WIP and not integrated into the CLI

[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends) is a tool provided by Google that provides insights in search trends
of specific terms. The search volume of one or up to five search terms is indexed from 0 to 100 in a given timeframe. The 
scope of the analysis can be further configured by parameters such as geography, category, or channel.

This pipeline builds on top of [pytrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends) which is used to query data from
Google Trends.

## Usage

To make sure you are running the latest version of the pipeline, build the Docker image from inside the `kuwala` 
directory by running:

```zsh
docker-compose build google-trends
```

### Parameters

The current pipeline retrieves the trend score for a search term per admin boundary in a given region by combining it
with the respective admin boundary. For this, the admin boundaries have to be generated first by running the 
[admin-boundaries](https://github.com/kuwala-io/kuwala/tree/master/kuwala/pipelines/admin-boundaries) pipeline.

Those are the command line parameters for setting the geographic scope and search term:
- `--continent`
- `--country`
- `--country_region` (optional)
- `--keyword`

### Starting the scraper

```zsh
docker-compose run google-trends --continent=<> --country=<> --country_region=<> --keyword=<>
```

### Rate Limits

In order to not run into rate limits, you have to use a proxy. You can specify the proxy address through the environment
variable `PROXY_ADDRESS` (e.g., when using Tor, the value should be `socks5://localhost:9150`). If you run the pipeline
through Docker, a proxy via Tor is automatically launched.
