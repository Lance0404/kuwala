# Population Density

Facebook publishes detailed population data with demographic information under its initiative 
[FACEBOOK Data for Good](https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/population-density-maps/).
It is one of the most granular data sets about the worldwide population using official census and Facebook data combined 
with image recognition.

![Population Density Overview](../../../docs/images/population_density_overview.png)

The raw data is aggregated in 1-arcsecond blocks (approx. 30x30 m) squares which we transform to H3 bins at 
resolution 11.<br/>
For each bin there is the statistical population value for:
- Total
- Female
- Male
- Children under 5
- Youth 15 - 24
- Elderly 60 plus
- Women of reproductive age 15 - 49

## Usage

To make sure you are running the latest version of the pipeline, build the Docker image from inside the `kuwala` 
directory by running:

```zsh
docker-compose build population-density
```

Those are the command line parameters for setting the geographic scope:

- `--continent` (optional)
- `--country` (optional)

To start the pipeline run:

```zsh
docker-compose run population-density
```

Follow the prompts to download, process and save data [1]

```console

## Working with the data

At the moment you can query the data directly using SQL on top of Postgres, or you can process the transformed results 
in Parquet format. We are working on a Jupyter notebook environment where you visualize the data directly and use 
functions to transform the data to your desired aggregation and ultimately send it to your destination. You can follow 
the progress on our [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/kuwala-io/kuwala/milestones) page.
